            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And here we cannot but freely declare, what we have obſerved from the beginning of the Parliament. That there was in both Houſes a party that intended the overthrow of the Government of Church, and States which when they could not effect in a Parliamentary way, and by free Voting, they rais'd and call'd down Tumults from London, to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thoſe Members of both Houſes that oppoſed them; that done, the aforeſaid party remaining at VVeſtminſter, <hi>call themſelves the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England,</hi> and under pretence of ſerving and ſecuring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they enter upon the <hi>Militia</hi> and take up Armes, and will never lay them down, till they have wholly altered the ancient, and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Government of the Kingdome.

               <p>Beſides when S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Nero</hi> was their Emperor; <hi>And ſo he that reſiſteth</hi> (Nero) <hi>reſiſteth the Ordinance of God; And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if that bloody Tyrant and Perſecutor <hi>Nero,</hi> might not be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,</hi> nor may any Emperour or Soveraign whoſoever, be invaded, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, depoſed, murdered, and the <hi>way for ſecurity,</hi> preſcribed to <hi>Subjects</hi> by the Apoſtle, is not to wreſt the ſword from the King, but to ſubmit and obey him; <hi>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame,</hi> v. 3.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (whatſoever befalls us, though we live under a <hi>Nero</hi>) <hi>we muſt needs be ſubject not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake. v.</hi> 5. <note place="margin">2 Chro. 9.8</note> And we know no medium between ſubjection and Rebellion, ſo that when we ceaſe to be Subjects, we neceſſarily become Rebells.</p>

               <p>And in truth, when of Gods Lieftenant, you would make the King only the Peoples chiefe Officer, your quarrell is not with the King on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Crown, but with God himſelfe alſo, the Author of politicall order, Power and Government. And whilſt you intend <hi>to depoſe the King,</hi> what do you but <hi>uſurp upon God himſelfe?</hi> For he removeth Kings, and ſetteth up Kings, <hi>Dan</hi> 2.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And do you provoke God to Jealouſie, are ye ſtronger then he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.22. And the manner whereby God promotes Kings with us is by <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Generation;</hi> and the meanes whereby he removeth them, is <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Death;</hi> Nor can the Reigne of a King of England <hi>duly</hi> be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude (as you do) with a word or two concerning the <hi>Kings Family:</hi> and ſhall cite ſome paſſages of the two Houſes of Parliament, 1. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We do upon the knees of our hearts agnize our moſt conſtant faith, obedience, and loyalty to your Majeſtie, and your Royall Progeny, as in this high Court of Parliament, where all the whole body of the Realm, and every particular Member thereof, either in perſon, or by repreſentation, (upon their own free Election) are by the Lawes of this Realme deemed to be perſonally preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>We (being bounden thereunto both by the Lawes of God and Man) do recognize and acknowledge, and thereby expreſſe our unſpeakable joyes, that immediately upon the diſſolution and deceaſe of</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>late Queen of England, the imperiall Crowne of the Realm of England, and of all the Kingdomes Dominions and Rights belonging to the ſame, did by inherent birthright, and lawfull and undoubted ſucceſsion, deſcend and come to your moſt excellent Majeſty, as being lineally, juſtly, and lawfully next and ſole Heire of the Blood Royall of this Kealme, and that by the goodneſſe of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and lawfull right of deſcent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>And we moſt humbly and faithfully ſubmit and oblige our ſelves, our heires, and poſterities for ever, untill the laſt drop of our bloods be ſpent, and do beſeech your Majeſty to accept the ſame, as the firſt fruits in this high Court of Parliament of our loyalty and faith to your Majeſty, and your Royall Progeny and Poſterity for ever.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>O the baſeneſſe and vileneſſe of the Engliſh Nation, thus to proteſt to the Father, yet to depoſe the Son, and to deſtroy the Poſterity! read the 17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16,18,19.</p>
               <p>But that is come to paſſe which was fore-told by S. <hi>Paul, In the laſt dayes perillous times ſhall come; for men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Parents, unthankefull, unholy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Without naturall affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, Traytors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleaſure more then lovers of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having a forme of godlineſse, but denying the power thereof: from ſuch turne away,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Finally, <note place="margin">Hoſ. 8.2. 10.2.</note> whereas you intend <hi>to ſettle the preſent Government without more adoe,</hi> we ſhall rather hearken to <hi>Solomons</hi> admonition, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with your reſolutions,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Son fear thou the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change; for their calamities ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> Prov. 24.21,22.</p>
